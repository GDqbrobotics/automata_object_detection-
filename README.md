# Automata Object Detection

This repository contains the source code for the Automata Object Detection project. The project is part of the European Project Automata and aims to detect irregular archaeological pieces of ceramics or lithics.

## Description

The Automata Object Detection project is a deep learning-based system that uses computer vision techniques to detect and classify irregular archaeological pieces of ceramics or lithics. The system is designed to assist in the analysis and identification of these artifacts, which can be challenging due to their complex and varied shapes.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/automata-object-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd automata-object-detection`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your test images: Place the images you want to analyze in a directory named `test_images`.
2. Run the object detection script: `python object_detection.py`
The script will process each image in the `test_images` directory and display the detected objects with their corresponding labels.
